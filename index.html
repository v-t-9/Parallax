            <h1>Parallax Effect</h1>
            <p>
                The parallax effect is a web design technique that creates an illusion of depth and movement by making different
                elements of a website scroll at different speeds.
            </p>
            
        </div>
       
          
        <div class="parallax2">
            <section id="grid">
                <h2 class ="benefits">Benefits</h2>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>
                        It can make a website more memorable and attractive by adding a sense of depth and dimension to the design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can create a storytelling effect by revealing different parts of the content as the user scrolls down the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can increase the engagement and retention of the visitors by encouraging them to explore more of the website and
                        interact with the elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can highlight the important and relevant information by making it stand out from the background.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>
                <ul class="drawbacks-list">
                    <li>
                        It can affect the performance and loading speed of the website by requiring more resources and code to create the
                        animations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can cause accessibility and usability issues for some users, especially those with low vision, motion sensitivity, or
                        older devices.
                    </li>
                  
                </ul>
                 
            </section>
        </div>

                Best Practices
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use it sparingly and selectively, only for the elements that add value and meaning to the website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test it thoroughly on different devices and browsers, ensuring that it works smoothly and does not break the
                    layout or functionality of the website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide alternative options for users who prefer a simpler or more traditional design, such as a button to
                    disable the parallax effect or a skip link to jump to the main content.
